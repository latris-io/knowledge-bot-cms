### **When to Run Regression Tests**

- **Before Production Deployments**: Always run `npm run test:use-cases`
- **After Major Changes**: Run affected use case tests individually
- **During Development**: Run relevant tests when modifying features
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Include `npm run test:use-cases` in automated testing

### **Troubleshooting Test Failures**

#### **Common Failure Patterns**

**JWT-related failures (UC-001, UC-003, UC-005):**
- ‚ùå `JsonWebTokenError: invalid signature` ‚Üí Check JWT_SECRET consistency
- ‚ùå `Property 'company_id' does not exist` ‚Üí TypeScript linting issue (can be ignored in tests)
- ‚ùå `Expected decoded.user_id to be undefined` ‚Üí Security test - user_id should NOT be in JWT

**Toast notification failures (UC-002):**
- ‚ùå Timeout errors in batching tests ‚Üí Tests involve 1+ second delays, expected behavior
- ‚ùå `Expected 1 notification, got 2` ‚Üí Batching logic issue, check timing

**File upload failures (UC-004):**
- ‚ùå `User must have both bot and company assigned` ‚Üí Expected for negative test cases
- ‚ùå Missing metadata properties ‚Üí Check object spread and assignment logic

**AI Chat failures (UC-005):**
- ‚ùå `Session ID does not match admin_ pattern` ‚Üí Check session generation logic
- ‚ùå Source extraction issues ‚Üí Verify regex patterns handle trailing periods
- ‚ùå Intelligent spacing failures ‚Üí Check sentence boundary detection logic

#### **Test Timing Considerations**

- **UC-002 takes longest** (11+ seconds) due to upload batching delay tests
- **UC-001, UC-003, UC-004** complete in under 1 second each
- **UC-005** takes 2-3 seconds due to async streaming simulation
- **Total runtime** for all tests: ~15-20 seconds

#### **Interpreting Success Metrics**

```bash
‚úÖ IDEAL RESULTS:
UC-001: ‚úÖ PASSED - 8/8 tests (100%)
UC-002: ‚úÖ PASSED - 12/12 tests (100%)  
UC-003: ‚úÖ PASSED - 15/15 tests (100%)
UC-004: ‚úÖ PASSED - 14/14 tests (100%)
UC-005: ‚úÖ PASSED - 25/25 tests (100%)

üéØ TARGET: 74+ tests passed, 0 failed
```

### **Adding New Test Scenarios**

When updating use cases or adding new functionality:

1. **Update the appropriate test file** in `tests/integration/use-cases/`
2. **Follow the existing test structure** with business rule references
3. **Test both success and failure scenarios**
4. **Update this documentation** if new use cases are added
5. **Run the specific test** to verify it passes before committing

### **Best Practices for Regression Testing**

#### **During Development**
- Run affected use case tests after making changes
- Use `npm run test:uc001 -- --watch` for continuous testing during development
- Check test coverage for new business rules

#### **Before Deployment**
- Always run `npm run test:use-cases` before production deployment
- Verify all 84+ tests pass with 100% success rate
- Document any expected failures if system is in transition state

#### **CI/CD Integration**
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions or similar
- name: Run Use Case Regression Tests
  run: npm run test:use-cases
- name: Require 100% Pass Rate
  run: |
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Use case regression tests failed - blocking deployment"
      exit 1
    fi
```
