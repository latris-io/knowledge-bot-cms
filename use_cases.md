## üéØ **Core Use Cases**

### **UC-001: User Validation and Management**

#### **Description**
System validates that users have both Bot and Company assigned before saving, and automatically generates widget installation instructions with JWT tokens when both fields are present.

#### **Actors**
- **Primary**: System Administrator
- **Secondary**: Strapi Admin Interface, Lifecycle Hooks

#### **Preconditions**
- User has access to Strapi admin interface
- Bot and Company entities exist in the system
- User record is being created or updated

#### **Main Flow**
1. Administrator opens user record in admin interface
2. Administrator fills in user details
3. **If Bot OR Company is missing**:
   - System shows validation error toast: "‚ùå Validation Error! Bot and Company are required before saving. Please select both fields."
   - User record is NOT saved
   - Administrator must select both fields to proceed
4. **If both Bot AND Company are selected**:
   - System validates final state after connect/disconnect operations
   - System generates JWT token with `{ company_id: X, bot_id: Y }`
   - System creates widget installation instructions with embedded JWT token
   - User record is saved successfully
   - No success toast is shown (silent success)

#### **Alternative Flows**
- **A1**: User exists with Bot but no Company ‚Üí Validation fails on save
- **A2**: User exists with Company but no Bot ‚Üí Validation fails on save  
- **A3**: User has both fields but removes one ‚Üí Validation fails on save
- **A4**: Database error during save ‚Üí Generic error handling

#### **Postconditions**
- User record is saved with both Bot and Company assigned
- JWT token is generated and stored in instructions field
- Widget installation instructions are available
- Validation state is enforced in database

#### **Business Rules**
- **BR-001**: Bot field is mandatory for all user saves
- **BR-002**: Company field is mandatory for all user saves
- **BR-003**: JWT token format: `{ company_id: number, bot_id: number }`

2. System validates user data in lifecycle hooks
3. System shows red error toast: "‚ùå Validation Error! Bot and Company are required before saving. Please select both fields."
4. Toast remains visible until manually closed
5. User save is blocked until validation passes

#### **Alternative Flows**
- **A1**: Multiple files uploaded simultaneously ‚Üí Single batched toast message
